Android example project with some challenges

Second sub-branch.<br/>
In this branch we started to define some application logic that can or can not work. You have to figure it out. ;-)<br/>
Here there are you challenges:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Correct eventually bugs present</li>
<li>Permit to use decimal numbers (i.e. 123.456 ...)</li>
<li>Add more functions</li>
